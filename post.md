## 1 Filling a gap with Social Authoring

Thanks to StackOverflow's *Social Q&A* platform, we have a reliable,
universal go-to for *long tail* software knowledge. "Long tail" meaning niche
topics that need to be found using lots of words like "Ace Editor onChange
event rendering performance with AngularJS". On the *short* end of the
spectrum, docs by Open Source creators and API companies provide excellent
answers for most queries like "AngularJS Directive". But what about questions
in between, like "How to scale a mobile chat system with Firebase?" or "Should
I use BackboneJS or EmberJS?".

Independent posts scattered across the web are our best tools when searching
for *medium tail* answers. However, unless you recognize an author, its hard to
know if you're about to read the best or even a good post on a given subject.
From the publishing perspective, ***writing high quality long form technical
content is hard*** and often even harder to maintain. Yet more frameworks are
appearing faster and faster each year and with it comes *** a challenge to
cover permutations of using different technolgoies together to solve real world
problems ***. 

The Social thing worked for Q&A on Stackoverflow. It also worked for coding on
GitHub. It even worked for long form encyclopedia content. Can we step-up
developer authoring and create better technical content, more efficiently than
ever before with some sort of stackoverflow-github-wikipedia hybrid Social
magic?

### 1.1 Announcing Social Authoring on AirPair

Pretty much anything part Git, or Octocat related is going to be cool. If
you've already enjoyed some of the epic community posts that have gone
viral on  AirPair, it gives me great pleasure knowing from today our
community content is  about to get way more awesome, because ***authors can
now work with readers using Forks and Pull Requests***.

With our new *GitHub Powered Workflow*, we hope to usher collaboration
that will enable more accurate and refined technical writing.

![Collaborate on post using
Git](/static/img/pages/posts/authoring-flow.png)

In this post, I'll cover how we integrated GitHub and many cool 
opportunities that make our new authoring setup significant. We'll end
leading into our ***$100,000 Developer Writing Competition***. 

Before diving into details, here's a screenshot to get you thinking:

### 1.2 Benefits of Social Authoring

**For readers**

- More proofed, comprehensive and up to date technical content than ever
before 
- Clear quality signals with what posts are worth reading
- The **ability to contribute** small bytes, without the level of understanding
required to author an entire post

**For authors**

- Exposure to more feedback than publishing elsewhere
- Crowdsourced help with improving post quality
- A forum to bounce new ideas before they become public
- Instant exposure for great work (with or without a social
following)

### 1.3 Getting involved

- **[Starting a post](/posts/new)** is a piece of cake. Everything is
private until you submit to the community 
>[![Star a
post](//airpair.github.io/img/2015/02/start-post.png)](/posts/new)

- Hit the *fork* button in the right rail to start contibuting to someone else's post
>[![Review a
post](//airpair.github.io/img/2015/02/fork-button.png)](#review)

- Give feedback with the review widget at the bottom of each post
>[![Review a

- Help community vet and Q/A **[Posts in review](/posts/in-community-review)**
waiting to get published

- Bookmark this post if you want to come back to it later

## 2 Why we built publishing on Git

If you're more interested in the technicalities on what and how we built
things, you might want to jump to <a href="#3-1-our-3-step-authoring-workflow">section 3</a>. This section is all
about the why and in `2.1` I'll cover *philosophically* how combining Git with
long form technical writing can be evolutionary for the developer community. In
`2.2` I'll touch on content marketing *economics* we believe Git will help
solve. Our main drive to build all this was to thank the authors by making the
authoring *user experience* easier, more fun and more impactful. `2.3` will
talk about how git makes authoring on airpair.com an edge compared with
anywhere else.

### 2.1 When (Developer) Ideas Have Sex

I can't recommend enough: set aside 15 minutes to absorb my all-time
favorite TED Talk - [When ideas have
sex](http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex?language=en) - 
by Matt Ridley.

[![Matt
Ridley](//airpair.github.io/img/2015/01/matt-ridley.png)](http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex?language=en)
> The short version

> **Ridley presents evolution as an accelerating byproduct of
sharing ideas:**

> *"To answer our continual ability to attain more wealth and improve our
own living standards, you need to understand how human beings bring together
their brains, and enable their ideas to combine and recombine, to meet and
indeed to mate."*


One part of the talk that is particularly relevant to software, is the notion
of our ***intellectual acceleration***. The more we interact, converse and
exchange knowledge, the more our ideas combine and mutate forming new ideas and
products. Things you and I conceive day-to-day as single ideas, actually embody
previous ideas originating from thousands or even millions of individuals.

> ![Stone
Axe](//airpair.github.io/img/2015/02/matt-ridley-stone-axe.jpg) 

Interestingly, as ideas become more evolved, they are even more quickly
superseded. The Stone Axe was used for thirty thousand years, yet iPhones are
now out of fashion within a few months.

> ![Mouse](//airpair.github.io/img/2015/02/matt-ridley-computer-mouse.jpg) 

** 2.1.1 (Developer) Intellectual Acceleration **

As developers, we've seen hands down what Ridley is talking about. Every year
the cycle of new frameworks appearing, spreading worldwide and becoming second
best, gets shorter. Largely thanks to GitHub making Open Source mainstream,
*Developer ideas having sex* is old news. 

AirPair's thesis for existing, is based on an observation: *As we make better
software faster and faster, we'll need more efficient and powerful ways to
express, share and consume the knowledge embedded in our code.*

** 2.1.2 Socially creating better content faster **

We're primarily known for connecting developers over
video chat for live one-on-one help. But our broader mission is to find new
ways to create relationships between developers that enable more efficient
knowledge share. 

So with our mission in mind, we'd love you to join our experiment
to see if we can reproduce what Stackoverflow did for Q/A starting a
Wikipedia-like community using the same tools GitHub used to usher in the era
of Social Coding.

### 2.2 How Git Improves ROI on Content Marketing

We had great success in our first 6 months pushing community content. The
average post published on AirPair in January 2015 received more than 15,000
views. Our 24 hour record is 35,000 reads and the most trafficked post has been
visited 250,000+ times. 

> ![AirPair Traffic Growth](/static/img/pages/postscomp/traffic-growth.png) 

The seeding phase was however, expensive and unsustainably heavy on internal
manpower. To keep up the quality and pace incumbent of our initial success, we
needed to decrease the effort of finding authors, reduce the time our internal
team assited with editing. 

Every publisher dreams of ***user generated content*** magically
appearing. From experience, we can tell you, great content takes time and
energy. During our seed phase, each post consumed around 10 hours of internal
manpower. There's no shortcut, so we've built a crowdsourcing review and rating
system to crowdsource vetting and Q/A before our internal team gets involved.

> ![Crowdsourced Editng](//airpair.github.io/img/2015/02/post-rating-signal.png)

A great side effect is that stars immediately indicate to readers as the browse, which posts to pay attention to.

### 2.3 What Git offers to the Authoring Experience

** 2.3.1 Sharing editorial load with Pull Requests ** 

Editing is a particularly time and energy intensive step in publishing. The last 10% of changes usually require a disproportionate amount of time and are the least fun... The same git flow you know and love for code review can enable fresh eyes that have spotted fixes to send them to you.

> ![Crowdsourced Editng](//airpair.github.io/img/2015/02/crowdsourced-post-editing.png)

**2.3.2 Extend content life time and relevance** 

We've covered how software moves exceptionally quick. The unfortunate byproduct
is, software content decays exceptionally fast too. Often the principals of a
piece remain relevant, but as new framework versions emerge, it becomes unclear
if the content is still useful. Maintaining content against moving code bases
has never really been possible as an individual and is an unwiedly endevour for
companies. Git provides a way to collaboratively maintain posts through forks
and pull requests. It can even be used to tag and retrieve iterations relevant
to specific framework versions.

** 2.3.3 Discussing evolving ideas with Github Comments ** 

GitHub issues, discussions and comments provide an amazing opportunity to get
feedback that will force you to re-think the subject matter. Influencers
will help you reinforce your arguments and less advanced readers will force you to simplify and present concepts in clearer ways. 

## 3 What we built

### 3.1 A 3-Step Authoring Workflow 

All posts go through 3 phases. Authors, Contributors and Editors have varying visibility and functions at each stage:

![3 Step Authoring Workflow](//www.airpair.com/static/img/pages/posts/social-authoring.png)

### 3.2 Leveraging GitHub as much as possible 

We wanted to use as much existing functionality provided by GitHub's API and github.com as we could. Not only does GitHub already have rock solid discussion
capabilities, merge tools and such that we didn't want to rewrite, Developers are already familiar with and love their tooling.  

Theoretically, once a contributor forks a post, they can work exclusively on github.com or from their own environment to send suggested edits back to the author. The AirPair editor does hide some complexities though.

### 3.3 Editing, previewing and storing posts

** 3.3.1 Posts in `DRAFT` **

Authoring starts in our live editor. Posts are written in markdown via Cloud 9's [ace web IDE](http://ace.c9.io/). Next to the editor we periodically preview how the body of your post would render using the [marked library](https://github.com/chjj/marked"). 

> ![AirPair Live Editor](//airpair.github.io/img/2015/02/edit-post.png)

In DRAFT, things are simple. A single version of your markdown is stored in our database without any versioning or edit history. We wanted authors to be as comfortable as possible splatting whatever comes out of your head with no consequence or papertrail. When you click the PREVIEW button to see a full page preview your post, you will see the same copy of your draf markdown stroed in our db.

** 3.3.2 Post in `COMMUNITY REVIEW` **

When a post is submitted to the community for review, a *master* open source repo is created on [AirPair's Github organization account](//www.github.com/airpair) so that authors can begin to recevie pull requests with suggested improvements. All edit history from this point ise tracked by git and can be explored by anyone on github.com same as any other open source code base.

>  ![AirPair Live Editor](//airpair.github.io/img/2015/02/my-contributions.png)

To give authors permissions to edit and accept pull requests to the master repository we create an `organization team` exclusively for a post's repo adding only the author with write privilages.

A post's markdown is stored in a `post.md` on a branch called "Edit". Using a branch stops the post.md getting indexed by google. You're welcome to make edits to your post from any environment you like, but you will need to stay on the `edit` branch.

*** From the author point of view ***,
when authors edit from the AirPair editor, they are editing HEAD on the `edit` branch from the master repository. The preview feature reads this same file. The version displayed to reviewers comes from a completely different source, the same placeholder in our database that previously stored the posts' markdown file in draft. This has two nice side effects. (1) We don't have to make round trips to github when showing a post to other users. (2) Authors can make changes and preview them without effecting the live version displayed to reviewers.

When the editor says your posts is `unsynced`, it means there is a newer version in git than being shown to others. Authors can SYNC changes from HEAD to the version in our database whenever they like. 

***From a contributors point of view***, when a contributor edits from the AirPair editor, they are editing HEAD on the `edit branch from THEIR FORKED repository. The preview feature reads this same file (on their fork). This is super cool, as an author can edit master and preview their changes as the same time a contributor makes and previews their own. All of this happens while the version other reviwers are seeing continues to be served and intact from our database.

***All pull request and mergeing*** activity happens on GitHub.com via pull requests from the `edit` branch of a fork to the `edit` branch of the master repo on AirPair's org account.

** 3.3.3 `PUBLISHED` Posts **

`PUBLISHED` posts take advantage of all the same forking and merging
goodness as posts in `COMMUNITY REVIEW`. Everything is stored in all the same places. Contributors can continue to fork. Authors can continue to edit. The only exception is that a user must have AirPair `editor` privilages to `sync` HEAD to the published version of a post.  

### 3.4 Visibility, Ratings & Publishing

** 3.4.1 Posts in DRAFT **

Post in draft are visible only to the author. They are not surfaced anywhere around the airpair.com website. As such they cannot be reviewed or given ratings. No repo exists, so no forking and merge activity is possible.

** 3.4.2 Posts in COMMUNITY REVIEW **

In review, posts are semi-private, in the sense that they are not shown in our main [posts section](//airpair.com/posts) and are not indexable by google. Users can only access posts if logged in. And all posts in review can be found on the [posts section](//airpair.com/posts/in-community-review) In Community review page. This is to allow an author to present unfinished work without permanent consequences.

Even reviews given by other users can be updated at anytime, so don't worry if someone gives you criticism. All you have to do is convince them through improving your work to take it down and replace their comment with a more positive one.

A post in review can be published by its author once it has 3 reviews with a 3.5/5 start rating or higher.

** 3.4.2 PUBLISHED Posts **

Published posts are visible by anyone, whether logged in, anonymous or actually a computer. Users will need an AirPair account to fork posts and leave reviews, though they will be able to read reviews by others without being logged in.

## 4 Conclusion

We hope this project is as impactful as we think it can be. At AirPair we come
to work each day focused on how we enable knowledge transfer from one developer to another. We hope to see your posts and contributions. If you haven't yet, now is a great time to check out our $100k Writing Competition.
